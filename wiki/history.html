			program No.Mercy but was eliminated during episode 7.[5] During the group's first showcase, Laun revealed
			that he was a trainee at Big Hit Entertainment and used to train together with boy group BTS.[6] All seven
			members were eventually introduced as WM Boys, and had their first appearance as B1A4's backup dancers at
			the 2016 Dream Concert in Seoul.[7][8] In addition, member J-Us, Laun, and Wyatt made a cameo appearance in
			labelmate B1A4's mini drama VCR "The Class", while E-Tion and Wyatt appeared in another B1A4 VCR called "Feeling".
			Hyojin, E-Tion, J-Us, and Wyatt were featured as dancers in the Korean version of the web drama Loss:Time:Life.
